# NASA 2024 Challenge - Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2024. The goal was to analyze and visualize Earth observation data to support agricultural decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Dataset**: Earth observation data related to soil fertility and various elements.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for initial data preprocessing before importing into Power BI.

## Data Visualization
The project involved creating multiple dashboards in Power BI, which included:
1. **Soil Fertility Analysis**: Visualizing the sum of soil fertility across different parameters.
2. **Elemental Composition**: Analyzing the contribution of elements like Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, and P to soil fertility.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing soil fertility levels with organic carbon (OC), sulfur (S), and other key elements.
4. **Distribution Trends**: Representing the trends of soil fertility against different elements using bar charts, pie charts, and line charts.

## Key Insights
- The analysis highlighted how different elements impact soil fertility.
- Soil fertility was found to have a strong correlation with elements like Zn and S.
- Elemental distributions showed significant variations across the dataset, influencing agricultural decision-making.

## How to Use
1. Open the Power BI file.
2. Navigate through the dashboards (Page 1, Page 2, etc.) to explore insights.
3. Use filters to customize the data visualization according to specific needs.

## Conclusion
This project successfully leverages Power BI to interpret complex soil data, helping researchers and agricultural experts make informed decisions using NASA's Earth observation data.
